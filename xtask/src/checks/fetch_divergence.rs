//! Enforce that web acquisition goes through ONE fetch path.
//!
//! # Why
//!
//! "Pipeline unification" (#298) unified the job/ledger model but left the
//! acquisition layer fragmented: `scrape`, `map`, the sitemap/llms.txt probes,
//! the Spider crawl, and the extract verticals each built their own HTTP
//! client with their own user-agent, redirect policy, retry rules, and (non-)
//! handling of bot walls.
//!
//! The cost was measured on 2026-07-29: adding a TLS-impersonation retry to the
//! map path recovered four Akamai-fronted sites, while `axon scrape` on the
//! same hosts still fetched a 380-byte "Access Denied" page and dropped it as
//! thin content while reporting success. One fix, applied once, reached exactly
//! one surface.
//!
//! This check makes that class of drift a build failure rather than something
//! discovered months later by a user with zero mapped URLs.
//!
//! # The rule
//!
//! Inside the acquisition crates, constructing an HTTP client directly is a
//! violation. Use `axon_core::http::fetch_web` (the shared ladder: plain fetch
//! → wall classification → browser TLS impersonation → re-classification).
//!
//! Exceptions live in [`APPROVED_EXCEPTIONS`], each with a written reason.
//! Adding an entry is a deliberate, reviewable act — which is the point.
