# docs/ — Documentation Structure
Last Modified: 2026-03-03

All project documentation lives here. This file defines the layout and the rules for what goes where.

## The Split: commands/ vs ingest/

These two directories cover the four ingest commands (`github`, `reddit`, `sessions`, `youtube`). They serve different readers and different questions.

### `docs/commands/` — "How do I use this command?"

The CLI reference. Written for someone at a terminal who needs to know what flags exist, what subcommands are available, and how to run common tasks.

**Belongs here:**
- Synopsis / usage line
- Arguments table
- All flags and their defaults (including command-specific flags)
- Job subcommands (`status`, `cancel`, `list`, `cleanup`, `clear`, `recover`, `worker`)
- Concrete usage examples
- Required environment variables (brief — what to set, not why)
- One-line install instructions for external dependencies (link to ingest/ for details)

**Does not belong here:**
- Step-by-step pipeline internals ("first it calls X, then Y…")
- Troubleshooting sections (→ ingest/)
- Known limitations tables (→ ingest/)
- Implementation details (function names, data structures)

### `docs/ingest/` — "How does this work / how do I set it up?"

The implementation and operations reference. Written for someone debugging a failure, setting up a new environment, or contributing to the ingest code.

**Belongs here:**
- Prerequisites with full installation instructions (Docker + local dev)
- What actually gets indexed (detailed, with conditions and exclusions)
- Step-by-step pipeline walkthrough with function names and code references
- Known limitations table (with root causes)
- Troubleshooting section (error messages → solutions)
- Environment variables (full list including optional infra vars like `TEI_URL`, `AXON_COLLECTION`)
- Developer guide (e.g. "Adding a new session format")

**Does not belong here:**
- CLI flags table (→ commands/)
- Job subcommand reference (→ commands/)
- Usage examples with `axon <cmd> <args>` (→ commands/)
- Async behavior / `--wait` explanation (→ commands/)

### Cross-Linking Rule

Every `commands/` file links to its `ingest/` counterpart:
```markdown
> For implementation details and troubleshooting see [`docs/ingest/<name>.md`](../ingest/<name>.md).
```

Every `ingest/` file opens with a back-link to its `commands/` counterpart:
```markdown
> CLI reference (flags, subcommands, examples): [`docs/commands/<name>.md`](../commands/<name>.md)
```

## Other Directories

### `docs/commands/` — all commands

Each command gets one file. For commands that don't have a paired ingest doc (e.g. `ask.md`, `search.md`, `research.md`), use the same structure: synopsis → flags → subcommands → examples → notes.

### `docs/plans/`

Implementation plans generated during development. Format: free-form markdown, named by feature (e.g. `crawl-performance.md`). Move to `docs/plans/complete/` when the plan is fully executed. Never delete — plans are the written record of why things are the way they are.

### `docs/sessions/`

Session logs: `YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-description.md`. Generated by `save-to-md` skill at session end. These capture decisions, root causes, and context for future sessions and agents.

### `docs/reports/`

Code reviews, audits, security analysis. Named by date and scope: `2026-02-22-full-review.md`.

### `docs/SCHEMA.md`

Database schema reference. Updated when tables are added or columns change. See `crates/jobs/*_jobs.rs` for the source of truth (`ensure_schema()` in each file).

## Writing New Docs

- **New command?** → Add `docs/commands/<name>.md` following the template above.
- **New ingest source?** → Add both `docs/commands/<name>.md` and `docs/ingest/<name>.md` with cross-links.
- **Implementation plan?** → `docs/plans/<feature>.md`.
- **Session summary?** → `docs/sessions/YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-<description>.md` via `save-to-md`.

Keep docs accurate to the code. If you change a flag name, default value, or scan path — update the doc in the same commit.
