# Axon Env Migration Matrix

Generated: 2026-05-15 from source-derived inventory.

**Current snapshot only.** This file is stale-prone and no longer the
authoritative future config contract. The target `.env`/`config.toml` split is
tracked in `docs/pipeline-unification/configuration/`; regenerate this matrix
from the current env registry before treating it as operational truth.

## Classification Key

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `keep-env` | Secrets, endpoint URLs, auth/runtime state — stays in `.env` |
| `compose-env` | Compose interpolation keys; Compose cannot read from TOML |
| `move-toml` | Legitimate non-secret operator tuning — moves to `config.toml` |
| `delete` | Obsolete/stale/removed (Postgres/AMQP/Redis/ACP/legacy queues) |
| `trusted-bootstrap` | High-impact local path/config overrides; treated as trusted operator input |
| `compat-shim` | Legacy name; retained briefly with deprecation warning |
| `external/test` | Dev or test only; not allowed in production templates |
| `hard-default` | Internal tuning; not intended as a user-configurable knob |

## Runtime Placement

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `both` | Needed on host and inside axon container |
| `host-only` | Host-side only; must not enter the axon container |
| `container` | Required inside the axon container |
| `compose-interp` | Compose file interpolation; never read by the Rust binary |
| `not-runtime` | Not read at runtime (docs-only, test, installer) |

### Host Build/Test Controls

These are read only by repository scripts during local build or test workflows.
They are not Axon runtime configuration and must not be added to production env templates.

| Key | Class | Placement | Notes | Source |
|-----|-------|-----------|-------|--------|
| `AXON_ARTIFACT_BIN_DIR` | external/test-only | not-runtime | Host-side build-script override for copied binary artifact destinations | scripts |

### Docker Compose Interpolation (compose-env)

These are read by Docker Compose from `~/.axon/.env` as variable substitution.
The Rust binary never reads most of them directly.

| Key | Class | Placement | Notes | Source |
|-----|-------|-----------|-------|--------|

### Move to TOML (migration.rs)

These env vars are being migrated to `config.toml`. Env override is retained temporarily with `WarnEnvOverride` behavior — setting them in env still works but emits a deprecation warning.

| Key | Class | Placement | TOML destination | Source |

| `AXON_ASK_CHUNK_LIMIT` | move-toml | not-runtime | `ask.chunk-limit` | migration.rs |
| `AXON_ASK_MIN_RELEVANCE_SCORE` | move-toml | not-runtime | `ask.min-relevance-score` | migration.rs |

| `AXON_LOG_MAX_BYTES` | move-toml | not-runtime | `logging.max-bytes` | migration.rs |

### Delete (legacy removed paths)

These keys belong to runtimes that were fully removed (RabbitMQ/AMQP queues,
Postgres, Redis, lite-mode). They are no longer registered in `migration.rs` or
any other registry module and have no runtime reads anywhere in `src/` (only
`#[cfg(test)]` fixtures assert they are ignored). Setting them has no effect;
remove them from any existing `~/.axon/.env` manually.

| Key | Reason |
|-----|--------|
| `AXON_BATCH_QUEUE` | Legacy AMQP queue name |
| `AXON_CRAWL_QUEUE` | Legacy AMQP queue name |
| `AXON_EMBED_QUEUE` | Legacy AMQP queue name |
| `AXON_EXTRACT_QUEUE` | Legacy AMQP queue name |
| `AXON_INGEST_QUEUE` | Legacy AMQP queue name |
| `AXON_AMQP_URL` | RabbitMQ/AMQP path removed |
| `AXON_LITE` | Lite-mode removed; accepted but no behavior change |
| `AXON_PG_MCP_URL` | Postgres path removed |
| `AXON_PG_URL` | Postgres path removed |
| `AXON_REDIS_URL` | Redis path removed |

## Direct Env Reads Covered by Registry

These keys are read directly in source code but already have registry classifications. This list is a cross-check, not an action queue.

### Direct Reads in src/

| Key | Read site | Registry class | Notes |
|-----|-----------|---------------|-------|
| `AXON_ASK_AUTHORITATIVE_DOMAINS` | `src/core/config/parse/build_config/config_literal.rs:243` | move-toml → `ask.authoritative-domains` | Registered in migration.rs |
| `AXON_CHROME_PROXY` | `src/core/config/parse/build_config/config_literal.rs:101` | keep-env | Registered in runtime.rs |
| `AXON_CHROME_USER_AGENT` | `src/core/http/client.rs:13,20` + `config_literal.rs:105` | move-toml → `chrome.user-agent` | Registered in migration.rs |
| `AXON_USER_AGENT` | `src/core/http/ua.rs` + `config_literal.rs` | keep-env | General-purpose UA override for all HTTP requests; AXON_CHROME_USER_AGENT falls back to this |
| `AXON_DOMAINS_DETAILED` | `src/cli/commands/domains.rs:21` | trusted-bootstrap | Registered in advanced.rs |
| `AXON_DOMAINS_FACET_LIMIT` | `src/cli/commands/domains.rs:30` | trusted-bootstrap | Registered in advanced.rs |
| `AXON_JOB_WAIT_TIMEOUT_SECS` | `src/jobs/backend.rs:148` | move-toml → `workers.job-wait-timeout-secs` | Registered in migration.rs |
| `AXON_LOG_FULL_QUERIES` | `src/services/search.rs:45` | trusted-bootstrap | Registered in advanced.rs |
| `AXON_LOG_MAX_BYTES` | `src/core/logging.rs:272` | move-toml → `logging.max-bytes` | Registered in migration.rs |
| `AXON_NO_WIPE` | `src/crawl/engine/dir_ops.rs:111` | trusted-bootstrap | Registered in advanced.rs |
| `AXON_SETUP_SKIP_SMOKE` | `src/services/setup/local/runtime.rs:94` | trusted-bootstrap | Registered in advanced.rs |
| `AXON_TEST_QDRANT_URL` | tests/ | delete/test-only | Registered in advanced.rs |
| `COLUMNS` | `src/core/config/help.rs` | hard-default | Standard Unix terminal env |
| `HOME` | multiple | hard-default | Standard Unix env; not user-settable |
| `NO_COLOR` | `src/core/logging.rs:122` | hard-default | Standard no-color.org env |

### Keys in .env.example Not in Registry

All keys previously in `.env.example` but missing from registry have been resolved:

| Key | Resolution |
|-----|-----------|
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | ✅ Added to runtime.rs as KeepEnv (ztqd.1) |
| `GOOGLE_API_KEY` | ✅ Added to runtime.rs as KeepEnv (ztqd.1) |

### Keys in Live ~/.axon/.env Not in Registry or .env.example

| Key | Status | Action |
|-----|--------|--------|
| `AXON_WEB_API_TOKEN` | ✅ Added to runtime.rs registry as KeepEnv (ztqd.1) | Done |
| `CHROME_URL` | ✅ Added to migration.rs as Delete (ztqd.1) | Done |
| `TEI_MAX_BATCH_TOKENS` | ✅ Added to advanced.rs as ComposeEnv (ztqd.1) | Done |

---

## TOML [services] Section — Action Required

`src/core/config/parse/toml_config.rs` still has:
```rust
pub services: TomlServicesSection,  // qdrant_url, tei_url, chrome_remote_url
```

These are marked `#[allow(dead_code)]` with deprecation doc comments but the parser accepts them. Per the boundary: service URLs are **env only**. The migration path must be one of:
- parse-warn-and-ignore (current behavior, acceptable short-term)
- parse-warn-and-move-to-env (setup/repair writes them to .env)
- clear repairable error naming the env replacements

Current status: parse-warn-ignore is already implemented (`#[allow(dead_code)]` + deprecation comments). The parser accepts them silently. **The open work is to emit a warning at startup when these fields are set.**

---

## ACP Variables (removed — axon_rust-387 done)

These were documented in older `docs/` and have **no source reads in `src/`** (the
ACP path was removed and Gemini headless standardized). They are absent from
`.env.example`. Remove any stragglers from a live `~/.axon/.env` manually:

- `AXON_ACP_*` (all variants)
- `AXON_ASK_AGENT`
- `AXON_ASK_BACKEND`

---

## Live ~/.axon/.env vs .env.example Delta

Keys in live env but not in .env.example (stale or operator-specific):
- `AXON_HOME` — redundant with `AXON_DATA_DIR`; trusted-bootstrap
- `AXON_HTTP_HOST` — set by Compose; trusted-bootstrap for local overrides
- `AXON_HTTP_PORT` — set by Compose; trusted-bootstrap for local overrides
- `AXON_WEB_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` — in advanced.rs registry; add to .env.example
- `AXON_WEB_API_TOKEN` — secret; registered in runtime.rs; add to .env.example if the sample should advertise web API auth
- `CHROME_URL` — stale alias; delete from live .env
- `OPENAI_BASE_URL` / `OPENAI_MODEL` — removed in 3.0.0; no longer registered in migration.rs (classified `external/test-only`, read only by scripts/tests). Remove them from any existing `~/.axon/.env` manually. (Note: the new `AXON_OPENAI_*` keys are the live OpenAI-compatible backend vars — distinct from these.) `OPENAI_API_KEY` is still ignored by Axon config, but may be forwarded to the isolated Codex child as an auth fallback for `AXON_LLM_BACKEND=codex-app-server`.
- `TEI_MAX_BATCH_REQUESTS`, `TEI_MAX_BATCH_TOKENS`, `TEI_MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS` — compose-env server args; already in registry

Keys in .env.example but not in live env (user hasn't set them):
- `AXON_IMAGE` — compose override; optional
- `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_API_KEY` — optional alternate credential paths

---

## Acceptance Criteria Status

| Criterion | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Migration matrix built from source-derived inventory | ✅ this doc |
| Each key classified with class + placement + secret risk | ✅ registry covers 101 keys |
| TOML destination for move-toml keys | ✅ migration.rs |
| Registry gaps identified | ✅ 14 src/ reads + 2 .env.example + 3 live .env |
| Direct env reads outside config parser documented | ✅ Gaps table above |
| No secret values printed | ✅ key names only |
| Container injection risk noted | ✅ compose-env / both placement |
| AXON_ENV_FILE / AXON_CONFIG_PATH shadowing risk noted | ✅ trusted-bootstrap with HostOnly |
| TOML [services] URL behavior documented | ✅ section above |
| CompatibilityShim vars classified for migration reporting | ✅ ztqd.4: env_migration.rs records them in setup migration output; no runtime warning log is emitted yet |
| .env.example cleaned of Delete/CompatibilityShim/ACP keys | ✅ ztqd.4: trimmed to 34 lines matching target structure |
| Stale Delete-classified keys confirmed absent from active src/ | ✅ ztqd.4: only appear in #[cfg(test)] fixtures in parse.rs |
| GEMINI_API_KEY and GOOGLE_API_KEY classified in registry | ✅ ztqd.1: added to runtime.rs as KeepEnv |
| CHROME_URL stale alias classified for deletion | ✅ migration.rs: Delete entry added |
| TEI_MAX_BATCH_TOKENS added to registry | ✅ advanced.rs: ComposeEnv entry added |

### Scope Note (ztqd.4)

`OPENAI_MODEL` and `OPENAI_BASE_URL` were removed in 3.0.0. They are no longer registered in `migration.rs`; the registry classifies them `external/test-only` (referenced only by scripts/tests that assert the removed OpenAI env is ignored). `OPENAI_API_KEY` is also ignored by Axon config, but the Codex app-server backend may forward it to the isolated child process as an optional auth fallback. Remove stale non-Codex OpenAI keys from existing `~/.axon/.env` files manually. There is no `axon setup repair` command; `axon setup init` adds missing keys but does not prune unknown ones.

### Keys Intentionally Dropped from .env.example (ztqd.4)

The following keys were in the old `.env.example` but are omitted from the new minimal target. They fall into two groups:

- **`keep-env` / `compose-env` / `trusted-bootstrap`** — still valid and honored at runtime when set; just not shown in the example template to keep the default minimal.
- **`delete`** — removed from the runtime entirely. Setting them has no effect; remove them from existing `~/.axon/.env` manually (there is no automated scrub command). The rows are listed here only to document that they were intentionally dropped (not accidentally forgotten).

| Key | Class | Reason omitted |
|-----|-------|---------------|
| `AXON_DATA_DIR` | trusted-bootstrap | Operator-specific path override; not default setup |
| `AXON_ALLOWED_REDIRECT_URIS` | keep-env | OAuth detail; omitted for brevity |
| `AXON_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | keep-env | CORS detail; omitted for brevity |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | keep-env | Optional alternate Google credential path |
| `GOOGLE_API_KEY` | keep-env | Optional alternate Google credential path |
| `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` | trusted-bootstrap | Service account path; not typical setup |
| `TEI_SERVER_MAX_CLIENT_BATCH_SIZE` | compose-env | TEI tuning; advanced use only |
| `OPENAI_MODEL` | external/test-only | Removed in 3.0.0; no runtime read. Remove manually from `~/.axon/.env` |
| `OPENAI_BASE_URL` | external/test-only | Removed in 3.0.0; no runtime read. Remove manually from `~/.axon/.env` |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | codex-child-auth | Ignored by Axon config; optional auth fallback forwarded only to isolated `codex app-server` child |
