# Context Injection Pipeline

How Axon retrieves, ranks, and assembles the `Context:` block that is injected into the RAG LLM prompt for `ask` and `evaluate`.

---

## Overview

Every `ask` and `evaluate` command goes through the same five-stage pipeline before any LLM call is made:

```
Query
  └─► 1. Embed          — TEI converts query text to a dense vector
  └─► 2. Retrieve       — Qdrant ANN search returns up to N candidate chunks
  └─► 3. Filter         — Low-signal and allowlist guards narrow the pool
  └─► 4. Rerank         — Lexical + domain boosts re-order by combined score
  └─► 5. Build context  — Chunks and full docs assembled into a string
                              └─► injected as "Context:\n..." into the LLM prompt
```

The assembled `context` string is passed directly to the LLM as part of the user message:

```
Question: {query}

Context:
{context}
```

---

## Stage 1 — Embed the Query

`retrieval.rs → retrieve_ask_candidates`

The raw query string is sent to TEI (Text Embeddings Inference) via `tei::tei_embed`. TEI returns a single dense float vector. This vector is the semantic representation of the question and is used as the search key against Qdrant.

```
"how does axon crawl work?"
        ↓ TEI
[0.023, -0.441, 0.118, ...]   (1024-dim or model-dependent)
```

---

## Stage 2 — Retrieve Candidates from Qdrant

`retrieval.rs → retrieve_ask_candidates`

`qdrant::qdrant_search` performs an approximate nearest-neighbour search using the query vector. The number of candidates fetched is controlled by `cfg.ask_candidate_limit` (env: `AXON_ASK_CANDIDATE_LIMIT`, default varies).

Each result comes back with:
- `score` — cosine similarity (0–1) from the vector search
- `url` — source page URL stored in the Qdrant payload
- `chunk_text` — the raw text of that chunk

Chunks with fewer than 40 characters are dropped immediately.

---

## Stage 3 — Filter

`retrieval.rs → retrieve_ask_candidates`

Two guards run after retrieval:

### Low-signal filter

URLs matching these patterns are dropped unless the query itself is about sessions/logs:

| Pattern | Rationale |
|---------|-----------|
| `/docs/sessions/` | AI session export files — noise for most queries |
| `/.cache/` | Build artefacts, not documentation |
| `/logs/` (local file path only) | Log files |
| `.log` (local file path only) | Log files |

The query is allowed to opt-in: if the query contains tokens like `session`, `log`, `history`, or the substring `docs/sessions`, the low-signal filter is bypassed.

### Authoritative allowlist filter

If `AXON_ASK_AUTHORITATIVE_ALLOWLIST` is set (comma-separated domains), any chunk whose URL does not match those domains (exact host or subdomain) is dropped entirely. This count is exposed in diagnostics as `dropped_by_allowlist`.

When the allowlist is empty (the default), all candidates pass.

---

## Stage 4 — Rerank

`ranking.rs → rerank_ask_candidates`

The filtered candidates are re-scored using a combined formula:

```
rerank_score = base_vector_score
             + lexical_boost    (capped at 0.30)
             + docs_boost       (0.04 if path has /docs/, /guides/, /api/, /reference/)
             + authority_boost  (cfg.ask_authoritative_boost if domain is in authoritative list)
             + phrase_boost     (0.06 if joined query tokens appear verbatim in chunk text)
```

**Lexical boost** details:
- `+0.045` for each query token found in the chunk's URL path tokens
- `+0.015` for each query token found in the chunk text tokens

Tokens are lowercased, split on non-alphanumeric characters, and stop-words are stripped (`the`, `and`, `for`, `how`, `what`, etc.).

After scoring, two post-rerank gates remove candidates that don't meet the bar:

1. `rerank_score < cfg.ask_min_relevance_score` (env: `AXON_ASK_MIN_RELEVANCE_SCORE`, default 0.1) → dropped
2. `candidate_has_topical_overlap` → dropped if the candidate shares too few tokens with the query

**Topical overlap thresholds:**

| Query token count | Minimum overlap required |
|-------------------|--------------------------|
| 1–2 tokens | ≥ 1 token match |
| 3–4 tokens | ≥ 2 matches, OR coverage ≥ 50% |
| 5+ tokens | ≥ 2 matches AND coverage ≥ 34% |

---

## Stage 5 — Build the Context String

`build.rs → build_context_from_candidates`

The reranked pool is now assembled into three tiers, in order. Each entry is separated by `\n\n---\n\n`. A running `context_char_count` is maintained; once the count would exceed `cfg.ask_max_context_chars` (env: `AXON_ASK_MAX_CONTEXT_CHARS`), no further entries are added.

### Tier 1 — Top Chunks

`select_diverse_candidates(reranked, cfg.ask_chunk_limit, 1)`

Selects up to `ask_chunk_limit` (env: `AXON_ASK_CHUNK_LIMIT`) chunks from the reranked list, enforcing a diversity constraint of at most 1 chunk per unique URL per selection pass. Each selected chunk is formatted as:

```
## Top Chunk [S1]: example.com/guide/crawl

<chunk text>
```

### Tier 2 — Full Documents

`select_diverse_candidates(reranked, cfg.ask_full_docs, 1)` → fetched concurrently from Qdrant

For up to `ask_full_docs` (env: `AXON_ASK_FULL_DOCS`) URLs, all stored chunks for that URL are fetched from Qdrant via `qdrant_retrieve_by_url`, capped at `cfg.ask_doc_chunk_limit` chunks per document. Fetches run concurrently up to `cfg.ask_doc_fetch_concurrency` (env: `AXON_ASK_DOC_FETCH_CONCURRENCY`) at a time, and results are re-sorted by original rank order before insertion.

This only runs if `context_char_count < max_context_chars`. Each full doc is formatted as:

```
## Source Document [S2]: example.com/api/reference

<all chunks concatenated>
```

### Tier 3 — Supplemental Chunks (backfill)

This tier fires only when **both** conditions hold:

1. Context is under 85% of `max_context_chars`
2. Either no full docs were selected, **or** fewer than 6 top chunks were selected

Supplemental candidates are those remaining in the reranked pool that were not already inserted as full docs, and whose `rerank_score ≥ ask_min_relevance_score + 0.05` (the extra 0.05 bonus raises the bar to avoid low-quality backfill). Up to `cfg.ask_backfill_chunks` (env: `AXON_ASK_BACKFILL_CHUNKS`) are selected with the same per-URL diversity pass. Each is formatted as:

```
## Supplemental Chunk [S3]: example.com/changelog

<chunk text>
```

### Final assembly

```rust
format!("Sources:\n{}", context_entries.join("\n\n---\n\n"))
```

This string is the `context` that flows into the LLM prompt.

---

## How Context Is Injected into the LLM

`streaming.rs → ask_llm_streaming / ask_llm_streaming_tagged`

The final user message sent to the OpenAI-compatible endpoint is:

```
Question: {query}

Context:
{context}
```

The system prompt (`ASK_RAG_SYSTEM_PROMPT`) instructs the model:

- Answer **only** from the retrieved context. No unstated prior knowledge.
- Perform a relevance check first (keyword overlap ≠ topical alignment).
- If relevant context exists: answer with inline citations like `[S1]`, `[S4]`.
- If no relevant context: say so and suggest what to index — **do not hallucinate**.
- End with a single `## Sources` section.

Temperature is fixed at `0.1` for both RAG and baseline calls, keeping outputs deterministic.

---

## Evaluate — Differences from Ask

`evaluate.rs` reuses `build_ask_context` for the RAG arm but adds:

- **Baseline arm**: runs the exact same question with no context (baseline system prompt tells the LLM to use its training knowledge).
- **Concurrent streaming**: both arms (`with_context` and `without_context`) stream simultaneously via a shared `mpsc::unbounded_channel::<TaggedToken>`, dispatched with `tokio::select!`.
- **Judge reference**: a second independent retrieval runs after both answers complete (`build_judge_reference`), fetching up to 8 diverse chunks for the judge LLM to use as ground truth. This is separate from the RAG context so the judge has an unbiased reference.
- **Judge prompt**: the judge receives both answers, timing info, source list, and the reference chunks. It scores each answer on Accuracy, Relevance, Completeness, and Specificity (each X/5), then issues a verdict.
- **Auto-suggest**: if RAG scores below baseline, `discover_crawl_suggestions` is called automatically and the suggested URLs are enqueued as crawl jobs.
