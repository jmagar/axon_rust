//! Process-wide LLM completion reservation pool.
//!
//! Per the provider contract
//! (`docs/pipeline-unification/runtime/provider-contract.md`, "LlmProvider
//! Contract"): "LLM calls use `llm` reservations and cannot consume embedding
//! capacity." This module gives LLM completion its own
//! [`ProviderReservationManager`] — a SEPARATE pool from the embedding/vector
//! managers in `axon-embedding::reservation` — so bulk LLM work (synthesis,
//! research, extraction) cannot starve interactive `ask`.
//!
//! [`crate::runtime::complete_text`]/[`crate::runtime::complete_streaming`]
//! reserve one unit from the singleton pool before dispatching to a backend,
//! and record success/failure on completion — this is the single choke point
//! every LLM caller passes through (ask synthesis, the `axon-core` extract LLM
//! fallback via [`crate::runtime::completer::BackendTextCompleter`], research,
//! summarize, evaluate, suggest, debug), so wiring it here covers all of them
//! without threading a reservation handle through every call site.
//!
//! Callers that need the `interactive` priority lane wrap their call with
//! [`with_priority`] — currently only the `ask` synthesis path
//! (`axon-vector::ops::commands::streaming::ask_llm_*`) does this. Every other
//! caller defaults to `JobPriority::Background`, which the shared
//! [`ProviderReservationManager`] refuses once granting it would eat into the
//! configured interactive reserve — see `preserves_interactive_capacity` in
//! `axon_observe::reservation`.
