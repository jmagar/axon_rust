/// other adapters), so letting them freely consume up to `concurrency`
/// general worker slots risks starving other job kinds or exhausting a

///

/// whether a `Source` job may be selected this time. A row is therefore
/// never flipped to `running` unless a worker is about to actually run it;
/// no claimed job ever sits parked waiting on a permit. This matters for two
/// reasons: (1) a `Source` job that can't get the source-specific permit
/// right now is left `queued` rather than claimed, so it never occupies a
/// general-concurrency slot while parked — other job kinds keep being
/// claimed and run even while the source lane is completely full; and (2) a
/// claimed job's first heartbeat is written essentially immediately (no
/// permit wait stands between claim and the task starting), so it can never
/// sit `running` with a stale heartbeat long enough for the watchdog to
/// reclaim it as abandoned while its task is still alive.
