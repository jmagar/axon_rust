//! AMQP connection utilities.
//!
//! # Two reconnect implementations
//!
//! This codebase has two AMQP consumer reconnect loops with different semantics:
//! - `crawl/runtime/worker/loops.rs::run_amqp_lane_with_reconnect()`: used by the crawl
//!   worker. Backoff resets to INIT on every successful reconnect.
//! - `worker_lane::run_job_worker()`: used by embed/extract/refresh workers.
//!   Backoff resets to INIT only after the connection has been alive for ≥ 60s.
//!
//! The difference is intentional: crawl jobs are long-running so a short-lived
//! connection that handles one job should not penalize the next reconnect.
